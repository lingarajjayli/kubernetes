# K8s Zero to Hero: The Gamified Path 🎮

Welcome to the ultimate Kubernetes crash course! This repository is your 14-day roadmap to mastering Kubernetes by actually building things that are fun—GAMES.

## 🚀 The Mission
Master K8s by breaking it. We won't just learn theory; we'll deploy Doom, 2048, and even Minecraft while learning how to scale, heal, and manage production-grade clusters.

## 🛠 Tools You'll Need
Before you start, make sure you have these installed:
- **Minikube**: Your local Kubernetes playground.
- **Docker**: The engine that powers our containers.
- **k9s**: A powerful CLI dashboard to manage your cluster in style.

## 📅 The 14-Day Roadmap
- **Day 01**: The Setup (Minikube & k9s)
- **Day 02**: Your First Pod (2048 Game)
- **Day 03**: Deployments & Self-Healing (Doom)
- ...and more coming soon!

Let's get started. Head over to [Day 01](./Day01/README.md) to set up your cluster!
