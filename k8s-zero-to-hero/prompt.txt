Act as a Senior Kubernetes Instructor.
I have created a flat repository structure: `k8s-zero-to-hero/Day01` through `Day14`.
I need you to generate the core content for the first 3 days.

**My Goal:** Learn Kubernetes practically by deploying GAMES (Doom, 2048, Minecraft).

**Task 1: Generate the Root README.md**
- Title: "K8s Zero to Hero: The Gamified Path 🎮"
- Explanation: A 14-day path to master K8s by breaking things.
- Tools Required: Minikube, Docker, k9s.

**Task 2: Generate Content for Day 01 (The Setup)**
- File: `Day01/README.md`
- Content:
  - Command to start minikube: `minikube start --driver=docker`
  - Command to install k9s.
  - Verification: `kubectl get nodes`

**Task 3: Generate Content for Day 02 (2048 Game)**
- File: `Day02/2048-pod.yaml`
- YAML Content:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: game-2048
      labels:
        app: game-2048
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: game-2048
        image: alexwhen/docker-2048
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
- File: `Day02/README.md`
- Instructions:
  - Apply: `kubectl apply -f 2048-pod.yaml`
  - View: `kubectl port-forward pod/game-2048 8080:80`
  - Play: Open `localhost:8080` in browser.

**Task 4: Generate Content for Day 03 (Doom Deployment)**
- File: `Day03/doom.yaml`
- YAML Content:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: doom
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: doom-game
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: doom-game
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: doom
            image: ocr.jfrog.io/docker-doom:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
- Challenge: "Kill a pod in k9s (Ctrl+D) and watch it resurrect."

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use Markdown.
- Keep it fun and concise.
